              Supply chains are often opaque.  We have significant experience working with investors, multinationals and their supply chains and have worked on this issue with (amongst others) UN Principles for Responsible Investment and the Chartered Institute for Purchase and Supply.
                    ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) investor & multi-national supply-chain engagement strategy and implementation.
                    Assistance with TCFD (Taskforce on Financial Related Climate Disclosure) responses to investors (including working on the joint Institute and Faculty of Actuaries (IoFA) and Institue of Environmental Management & Assessment (IEMA) Financial Related Climate Disclosures working group.
                    Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) - materiality and supply-chain risk assessment
                    Working with our partners in Horizon Ledger we have developed a DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) based tool to accurately map the supply-chain, benefiting from zero-knowledge proof.  This enables the identification of supply-chain exposure to capital and ESG risks. This is being piloted on specific issues associated with the SDG and regulation such as the Modern Slavery Act 2015. Also being used to map SDG materiality and geographical risk.
                    Please contact us to join the pilot group
